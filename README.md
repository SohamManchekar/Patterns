# Patterns in C++

Pattern programming means printing different patterns, such as triangles, pyramids, rectangles, etc., using a programming language.

Pattern programming in C++ requires a decent knowledge of loops or, more specifically, nested loops. While writing code(s) to print patterns using special characters, numbers, and alphabets makes one understand how the loops work internally.
